Background:

There have been a few reviews recently. Here are the ones slated to be organized here:

(O’Brien 2017), (Nagy and Rash 2017), (Miller and Pereda 2017), (Pereda 2016), (Curti and O’Brien 2016), (O’Brien 2014), (Pereda et al 2013), (Goodenough and Paul 2009), (Bennett and Zukin 2004)



preferential conduction in one direction:
(Furshpan & potter 1959, Haas 2011, shruti 2014?)


with Inap
There are a fair number of cases for this. Would it be appropriate to cite one preceded with “e.g.” to make it clear it’s drawn from a larger set?

Alcami and Pereda 2019’s refs for more:
64,69–71.

This could also be helpful: Would let us refer back to golgi for a situation dependent effect.
Electrical coupling mediates
tunable low-frequency oscillations and resonance
in the cerebellar Golgi cell network. Neuron 61,
126–139 (2009).


Can also supplement this with Mauthner cell experiments:
Curti et al 2012
Curti and pereda 2004





#eltd in retina
I don’t know of a specific publication with activity dependent LTD, but the retina’s coupling is  “∩” shaped as ambient light increases, so I can probably find something close enough if cleaving to parallelism is worth it.

Retina electrical 
Studies in the retina showed plasticity: 
•	LTD: (DeVries and Schwartz, 1989; Lasater, 1987; Lasater and Dowling, 1985; McMahon et al., 1989; Picco- lino et al., 1984; Spray and Bennett, 1985)
•	LTP: (Wang et al., 2015b; Yang et al., 1990).
